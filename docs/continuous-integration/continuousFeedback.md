# Continuous Feedback

## The Right Information

* With automated build process you can determine the right information to be given to the right people
* Build status information like you can add to github/bitbucket are good build indicators

## The Right People

* Make sure that the right information goes to the right people
* Different people require different information
* Don't flood people with irrelevant information they will soon ignore them
* CI helps get the right information to the right people

## The Right Time

* Information that is old is not useful, if the build is broken you need to get notified immediately
* More time between defects will further gap that developers have for each particular software componet
    * Do you really remember what you did 2 months ago, 2 weeks ago?

## The Right Way

* The right way is choosing the most appropriate communication mechanism
* How to present said information and to whom

## Use Continuous Feedback Mechanisms

* Email
* SMS (Text messages)
* Ambient Org, Lights
* Wide Screen Monitors
